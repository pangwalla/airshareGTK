A simple GTK-based GUI for the [airshare](https://github.com/KuroLabs/Airshare) network sharing tool

## Features
+ Can use the send and receive server components

## Installation

Should be available in your application menu

## Known Issues
Let me know

Be sure to check your firewall for access to the default airshare port (8000)
